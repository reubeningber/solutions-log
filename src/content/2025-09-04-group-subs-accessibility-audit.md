## Context
Ticket was broad and complex, making scope unclear and timeline unrealistic.

## My Contribution
Completed a thorough review using Jira AI  to [break down the work into five key areas](https://businessinsider.atlassian.net/browse/ET-2319?focusedCommentId=189180), identified complexity, and worked with PMs and stakeholders to extend the deadline and split off part of the work

## Outcome / Impact
- Provided clarity on scope, avoided delivery risks, and improved cross-functional alignment. 
- Learned some of the power of Jira's AI. Very interested in exploring this tool more.
