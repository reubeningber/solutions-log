## Context
The initial implementation by Engagement Engineers took several sprints but was not acceptable when reviewed by Creation engineers. Work wasnâ€™t aligned with current Muse standards and Creation had prior technical solutions in mind.

## My Contribution
Identified root causes in retros/1:1s, coordinated with Creation Manager, and set a new process: When taking on new Muse projects Engagement will ask if we should have a technical implementation meeting before work begins.

## Outcome / Impact
Prevent future misalignment, improved cross-team clarity, and established a repeatable process for Muse work.
