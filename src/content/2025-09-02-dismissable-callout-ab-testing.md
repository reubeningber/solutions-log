## Context
The initial implementation had a rigid A/B test design, making the component less reusable. Was told that the engineers' attempts to create a loop failed.

## My Contribution
Persisted in pushing for a better approach, was told impossible. Decided to spend an hour debugging, and implemented a viable loop solution.

## Outcome / Impact
Delivered a more  reusable component, enabled flexible AB testing, and raised code quality.
