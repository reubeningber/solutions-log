## Context
On a number of occasions we have forgotton to include the fastly query parameters to load the appropriate image size for the feature. In Sprint Planning there was a ticket that had a feature with new images. 

## My Contribution
Added explicit implementation notes and clarified requirements during sprint planning.
## Outcome / Impact
Hopefully prevented future errors, ensured correct implementation, and improved team efficiency.
